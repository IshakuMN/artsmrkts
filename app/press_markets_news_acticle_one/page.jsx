                        Index (US30) was down 0.54%, while the S&P 500 Index (US500)
                        was down 0.30%. The NASDAQ Technology Index (US100) closed positive 0.25%. The S&P 500 index
                        (US500) and the Dow Jones (US30) fell to 2-week lows. Signs of weakness in the US labor market
                        added to concerns about the economy’s growth and negatively impacted stocks on Thursday after
                        August ADP employment data showed employers added the fewest jobs in 3 years. Stocks also came
                        under pressure after the ISM Services Business Activity Index for August unexpectedly rose.</p>
                    <p className="text-[20px] leading-[24px] text-customBlackFour">Today, the US will release labor
                        market data for August. Economists expect the US economy added
                        164,000 jobs in June after 114,000 in the previous month. The weaker-than-expected data for July
                        caused turbulence in the market, instilling fears of a possible recession in the US. Therefore,
                        any signs of a weakening labor market could revive fears about the prospect of a recession and
                        cause further market turmoil. It should also be noted that historically, September and October
                        can be volatile for stocks and indices. Such a scenario could hurt both the US dollar and stock
                        indices. Typically, these instruments are in inverse correlation, but in this economic
                        situation, they could fall in sync. A strong labor market report would indicate that the economy
                        is moving toward a soft landing, which would be positive for the indices.

                        2.4% month-on-month in July 2024, compared to market
                        estimates of a 0.3% drop and following an upwardly revised 1.7% rise in the previous month. It
                        was the third straight year-on-year decline. Germany’s trade surplus narrowed to €16.8 billion
                        in July 2024 from €20.4 billion in June, well below estimates of €21 billion. It was the
                        smallest trade surplus since December 2022, as exports rose less than imports.

                        $69.4 a barrel on Friday and could fall sharply over the
                        week due to demand concerns in major oil markets. Recent data from China and the US showed
                        weakness in the manufacturing sectors, adding to concerns about slowing demand. In addition, a
                        potential increase in oil supplies from Libya put downward pressure after signals that political
                        factions in Libya are close to an agreement. However, some relief came from an unexpectedly
                        large decline in US crude oil inventories. EIA data showed that US crude inventories fell by 6.9
                        million barrels last week, well above market expectations of a 1.1 million barrel decline,
                        marking the ninth consecutive decline in crude inventories in the last ten months.
